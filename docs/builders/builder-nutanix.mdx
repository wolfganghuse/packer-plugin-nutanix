# Nutanix

Type: `nutanix`

<!--
  Include a short description about the builder. This is a good place
  to call out what the builder does, and any requirements for the given
  builder environment. See https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/null
-->

The builder builds a virtual machine by creating a new virtual machine from existing Image or Boot-ISO, customizing the OS and provisioning software within the OS, then shutting it down. The result of the Nutanix builder is a qcow2-image which is placed within the Image Service of the Prism Central Instance.
